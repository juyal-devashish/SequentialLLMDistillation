So, we can set up an equation based on the sum of the geometric progression:\n\nx + 2x + 4x + ... = 847\n\nStep 3: To find the sum of the geometric progression, we use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression:\n\nS_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere:\nS_n is the sum of the first n terms,\na is the first term,\nr is the common ratio,\nn is the number of terms.\n\nStep 4: In our case, the first term a is x, the common ratio r is 2, and the sum S_n is 847.

    "question": "Ralph is going to practice playing tennis with a tennis ball machine that shoots out tennis balls for Ralph to hit. He loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls to start with. Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them. Of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them. Out of all the tennis balls, how many did Ralph not hit?",
    "rationale": "Step 1: Let's find out how many tennis balls Ralph hit out of the first 100.  \nRalph hit 2/5 * 100 = 40 tennis balls out of the first 100.\n\nStep 2: Now let's find out how many tennis balls Ralph hit out of the next 75.  \nRalph hit 1/3 * 75 = 25 tennis balls out of the next 75.\n\nStep 3: Now let's calculate the total number of tennis balls Ralph hit.  \nTotal tennis balls hit = 40 (from the first 100) + 25 (from the next 75) = 65 tennis balls.\n\nStep 4: Finally, let's find out how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit.  \nTotal tennis balls = 100 (first set) + 75 (second set) = 175 tennis balls  \nTennis balls not hit = 175 (total) - 65 (hit) = 110 tennis balls.\n\nTherefore, Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls out of the total 175 tennis balls.",

    "question": "Jack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?",
    "rationale": "Step 1: Calculate the amount of salt in 2 liters of seawater.\nGiven that the water is 20% salt, it means that in 2 liters of seawater, 20% is salt. \n\nStep 2: Calculate the volume of salt in 2 liters of seawater.\nSince 20% of 2 liters is salt, we can calculate the volume of salt as follows:\nVolume of salt = 20% of 2 liters = 0.2 * 2 liters = 0.4 liters\n\nStep 3: Convert the volume of salt from liters to milliliters.\nSince 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, we can convert the volume of salt from liters to milliliters as follows:\nVolume of salt = 0.4 liters * 1000 ml/liter = 400 ml\n\nTherefore, Jack will get 400 ml of salt when all the water evaporates from the 2 liters of seawater.",
