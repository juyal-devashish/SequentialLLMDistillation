    "rationale": "Step 1: First, we need to convert 50 minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 50 minutes by 60 to get the equivalent hours.  \n50 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.83 hours  \nSo, Weng did 0.83 hours of babysitting.  \n\nStep 2: Next, we can calculate how much Weng earned by multiplying the hours she worked by her hourly rate.  \nEarnings = 0.83 hours * $12/hour  \nEarnings = $9.96  \n\nTherefore, Weng earned $9.96 for babysitting for 50 minutes yesterday.",

So, the weight of the box with the jelly beans is 2 pounds.\n\nStep 2: Ken added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. This means the weight of the brownies is 3 times the weight of the box with the jelly beans.

So, the total weight of the jelly beans in the box is x + 2 pounds.\n\nStep 4: Finally, Ken added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. This means the weight of the gummy worms is 2 times the total weight of the box with the jelly beans, brownies, and additional jelly beans. Therefore, the weight of the gummy worms is 2 * (2 + x + 6 + 2) = 2 * (x + 10) = 2x + 20 pounds.\n\nStep 5: The final weight of the box of goodies is the sum of the weights of the jelly beans, brownies, and gummy worms.

    "rationale": "Step 1: Let's denote the number of people on the first ship as x. Since each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, the number of people on the second ship would be 2x, the third ship would have 4x, and so on. \n\nStep 2: The total number of people eaten by the monster over the three hundred years is 847. So, we can set up an equation based on the sum of the geometric progression:\n\nx + 2x + 4x + ... = 847\n\nStep 3: To find the sum of the geometric progression, we use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression:\n\nS_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere:\nS_n is the sum of the first n terms,\na is the first term,\nr is the common ratio,\nn is the number of terms.\n\nStep 4: In our case, the first term a is x, the common ratio r is 2, and the sum S_n is 847. We need to determine the number of terms n.\n\nStep 5: Let's solve for n using the formula:\n\n847 = x(1 - 2^n) / (1 - 2)\n\nStep 6: Simplify the equation:\n\n847 = x(1 - 2^n) / -1\n\n-847 = x(1 - 2^n)\n\nStep 7: Since x is the number of people on the first ship, it must be a whole number.
