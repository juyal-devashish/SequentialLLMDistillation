    "question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?",
    "rationale": "Step 1: First, we need to convert 50 minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 50 minutes by 60 to get the equivalent hours.  \n50 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.83 hours  \nSo, Weng did 0.83 hours of babysitting.  \n\nStep 2: Next, we can calculate how much Weng earned by multiplying the hours she worked by her hourly rate.  \nEarnings = 0.83 hours * $12/hour  \nEarnings = $9.96  \n\nTherefore, Weng earned $9.96 for babysitting for 50 minutes yesterday.",

    "rationale": "Step 1: Let's start by calculating how many purple flowers Mark has in his garden. We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. Since Mark has 10 yellow flowers, we can calculate 80% of 10 to find out how many more purple flowers there are. \n\n80% of 10 = 0.8 * 10 = 8\n\nSo, Mark has 10 yellow flowers and 8 more purple flowers, totaling:\n\n10 yellow flowers + 8 purple flowers = 18 flowers\n\nMark has 18 purple flowers.",

    "question": "Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?",
    "rationale": "Step 1: Ken placed the box on a scale and added enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. Let's denote the weight of the jelly beans as x pounds. So, the weight of the box with the jelly beans is 2 pounds.\n\nStep 2: Ken added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. This means the weight of the brownies is 3 times the weight of the box with the jelly beans. Therefore, the weight of the brownies is 3 * 2 = 6 pounds.\n\nStep 3: Ken added another 2 pounds of jelly beans to the box. So, the total weight of the jelly beans in the box is x + 2 pounds.\n\nStep 4: Finally, Ken added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. This means the weight of the gummy worms is 2 times the total weight of the box with the jelly beans, brownies, and additional jelly beans. Therefore, the weight of the gummy worms is 2 * (2 + x + 6 + 2) = 2 * (x + 10) = 2x + 20 pounds.\n\nStep 5: The final weight of the box of goodies is the sum of the weights of the jelly beans, brownies, and gummy worms. Thus, the final weight is x + 6 + x + 10 + 20 = 2x + 36 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the final weight of the box of goodies is 2x + 36 pounds.",
